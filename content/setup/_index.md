# Molecule setup

Setting up Molecule involves 3 steps:

1. [Define your Data Model](/setup/data-model),
2. [Setup your project with sbt](/setup/sbt-setup)
3. Get a database connection:
   1. [Server-side (jvm) connection](/setup/jvm-connection)
   2. [Client-side (js) proxy connection](/setup/js-connection)

On the next pages we'll walk through those steps. 


## Quick-start Molecule sample projects

The fastest way to try out molecule is to clone the [molecule-samples](https://github.com/scalamolecule/molecule-samples) Github repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/scalamolecule/molecule-samples.git
```

and then open one of the sample projects in your IDE and play around making more molecules or add new attributes to the Data Model.
