Hi all,

Just released v0.16.1 of the meta-DSL library [Molecule](http://www.scalamolecule.org) ([Github](https://github.com/scalamolecule/molecule) | [Gitter](https://gitter.im/scalamolecule/Lobby) | [Docs](http://www.scalamolecule.org/api/molecule/)) that makes it intuitive and type-safe in Scala to access the [Datomic](https://www.datomic.com/on-prem.html) accumulate-only database where you can also query data back in time.

Molecule is a "meta-DSL" in that it generates boilerplate code from your initial schema definition so that 
you can intuitively use the tokens of your domain as the core building blocks of queries and transactions:

```
Await.result(
  // Asynchronously get Person data and related Address
  Person.name.age.Address.street.getAsync, 
  1 second
).map(_ ==> List(
  ("Lisa", 20, "Broadway"),
  ("John", 22, "Fifth Avenue")
)
```

Compare Molecule syntax with: [SQL](http://www.scalamolecule.org/compare/sql/), [Slick](http://www.scalamolecule.org/compare/sql/slick/), [Datalog](http://www.scalamolecule.org/compare/datomic/), [Gremlin](http://www.scalamolecule.org/compare/gremlin/). 


Hope you'll give it a spin! Any feedback is welcome.

Cheers,

Marc Grue
