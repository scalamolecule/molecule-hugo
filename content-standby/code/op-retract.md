# Retract

[Tests...](https://github.com/scalamolecule/molecule/blob/master/molecule-tests/src/test/scala/molecule/tests/core/crud/Retract.scala)


In Datomic, retracting a fact saves a retracted Datom with the `added` operation set to `false`. Retracted datoms will not show up in queries of the current data. But if you query historical data with for instance [asOf](/documentation/time/asof-since/) you'll see what the value was before it was retracted. This mechanism provides Datomic with built-in auditing of all of its data since none is deleted!

### Retract facts

To retract individual attributre values apply empty parenthesises to the attribute we want to retract and then update the molecule:


```scala
Community(belltownId).name().category().update
```
Here we retracted the `name` and `category` attribute values of the Belltown Community entity:


### Retract an entity

To delete a whole entity with all its attribute values we can call `retract` on a `Long` entity id

```scala
fredId.retract
```
All attributes having the entity id `fredId` are retracted.

### Add Tx meta data to retraction on entity id

Associate transaction meta data to a retraction on an entity id
```scala
fredId.Tx(MyUseCase.name("Terminate membership")).retract
```

We can then afterwards use the tx meta data to get information of retracted data:
```scala
// Who got their membership terminated and when?
Person.e.name.t.op(false).Tx(MyUseCase.name_("Termminate membership")).getHistory.map(_ ==> List(
  (fredId, "Fred", t3, false) // Fred terminated his membership at transaction t3 and was retracted
)
```


### Retract multiple entities

Alternatively we can use the `retract` method (available via `import molecule.imports._`)

```scala
retract(fredId)
```
This `retract` method can also retract multiple entities

```scala
val eids: List[Long] = // some entity ids 

// Retract all supplied entity ids
retract(eids)
```

### Add Tx meta data to retraction of multiple entity ids

.. and even associate transaction meta data to the retraction
```scala
// Retract multiple entity ids and some tx meta data about the transaction
retract(eids, MyUseCase.name("Terminate membership"))
```
Again, we can then afterwards use the tx meta data to get information of retracted data:
```scala
// Who got their membership terminated and when?
Person.e.name.t.op(false).Tx(MyUseCase.name_("Termminate membership")).getHistory.map(_ ==> List(
  (fredId, "Fred", t3, false), // Fred terminated his membership at transaction t3 and was retracted
  (lisaId, "Lisa", t5, false)  // Lisa terminated her membership at transaction t5 and was retracted
)
```


### Retract component entity

If a ref attribute is defined with the option `isComponent` then it "owns" its related entities - or "subcomponents", as when an `Order` own its `LineItem`s.

```scala
object ProductsOrderDataModel {

  trait Order {
    val id    = oneInt
    val items = many[LineItem].isComponent // Order owns its line items
  }

  trait LineItem {
    val product = oneString
    val price   = oneDouble
    val qty     = oneInt
  }
}
```

If we retract such `Order`, then all of its related `LineItem`s are also retracted:

```scala
orderId.retract // All related `LineItem`s are also retracted!

// or
retract(orderId)
```
Component entities are recursively retracted! So if `LineItem` would have had subcomponents then those would have been retracted too when the order was retracted - and so on down the hierarchy of subcomponents.




### Asynchronous retract

All transactional operators have an asynchronous equivalent.

Retracting entities asynchronously uses Datomic's asynchronous API and returns a `Future` with a `TxReport`.

Here, we map over the result of retracting an entity asynchronously (in the inner mapping):

```scala
// Initial data
Ns.int.insertAsync(1, 2).map { tx => // tx report from successful insert transaction
  // 2 inserted entities
  val List(e1, e2) = tx.eids
  Ns.int.get.map(_ ==> List(1, 2)

  // Retract first entity asynchronously
  e1.retractAsync.map { tx2 => // tx report from successful retract transaction
    // Current data
    Ns.int.get.map(_ ==> List(2)
  }
}
```
Retract multiple entities asynchronously:
```scala
// Initial data
Ns.int.insertAsync(1, 2, 3).map { tx => // tx report from successful insert transaction
  // 2 inserted entities
  val List(e1, e2, e3) = tx.eids
  Ns.int.get.map(_ ==> List(1, 2, 3)

  // Retract first entity asynchronously
  retractAsync(Seq(e1, e2)).map { tx2 => // tx report from successful retract transaction
    // Current data
    Ns.int.get.map(_ ==> List(3)
  }
}
```
